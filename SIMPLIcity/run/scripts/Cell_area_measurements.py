Title: Cell_area_measurements.py
Date: 2022-10-20
Author: Erno HÃ¤nninen
Description:
   - This script can be used to measure co-expression between two cells or three cells
   - And also to measure the area in pixels of individual and co-expressing markers
List of functions:
    -    area_measurements, overlap, test_overlap, watershed_and_contour
List of "non standard" modules:
    -    cv2, numpy, skimage, scipy, numpy

Procedure:
   - Read the input arguments and order it to dictinaries
   - call area_measurement function which loops over the dictionaries
   - if cell type contains / it means we are looking for co-expression
        - read the images and corresponding masks, run watershed to distinguish the clumped cells before detecting contours
        - take intersection of between the contour images
        - test for overlap between two cells, if two cells overlap more than user specified fraction, we have a co-expression
        - draw the co-expressing cell to result image
        - in case we are looking for triple co-expression, we have an additional step which filters out cells that don't have triple overlap. Here output from the overlap() function is used, and then draws the contours to the final image
        - Call watershed_and_contour function to extract the clumped objects in the resulting imgae
        - count the foreground pixels and the cells from the resulting image.
    - if no "/" mark in cell type, count the pixels which are not background
        - The cell counts of individual cells are computed else where from the annotated_cells.csv file
    - Resulting values are stored to dictinary
